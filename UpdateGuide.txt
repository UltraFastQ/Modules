Here is a quick guide on how to update the pip from the command prompt.
Make sure you have the latest version of the git first.
This procedure assumes that you are entering the command in the Git folder
Module.
1 : You need to change the version in the setup file in this folder.
    For minor version change the last number and so on depending of the
    importance of changes.
2 : Run the following : python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel 
    I am not aware of the way to do it in Windows for the moment.
    It should be done un the kernel or the conda prompt
    This will update the distribution required by pip. Make sure there 
    is only one version in the folder build. This will allow you to 
    push the version to pip.
3 : The next step requieres you to commit and push everything to git 
    that has been changed during the procedure.
4 : At last you will enter the following command : twine upload dist/*
    You then need to enter the username and the password of PyPi
    This should have changed the pip on the website.
5 : Then you can upgrade your package with : pip install --upgrade femtoMod
